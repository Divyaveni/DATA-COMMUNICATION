# DATA-COMMUNICATION

1qn) Write a program to implement line coding technique and generate the output waveform for
following inputs from the user:
a) Bit sequence (ex: 110010)
b) Sequence length (no. of bits present in the given sequence)
c) Width of the pulse(ex: 1 msec)
d) Type of Line coding (RZ/NRZ, Unipolar, polar, bipolar)
If possible, generate the equivalent frequency spectrum of the line coded output.

2qn) Write a program to implement Pulse Modulation Techniques and generate the output waveform
for following inputs from the user:
Type of modulation (PAM/PPM/PWM/PCM)
Baseband/Message signal
